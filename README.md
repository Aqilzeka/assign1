Welcome to Assignment 1 for [CS 253: Web Security](https://cs253.stanford.edu). âœ¨

We're doing client-side attacks! This assignment is all about Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Your goal is to come up with "attack inputs" that when entered into websites vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks you are able to execute any code you want in the victim's browser.

The assignment takes the form of an interactive workshop that you'll run in your browser. This is what it looks like:

## Prepare

### Get the starter code

Run this command, replacing `YOUR_SUNET_ID` with your SUNet ID (e.g. `feross`).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:stanford-web-security/assign1-YOUR_SUNET_ID.git
```

Enter the folder you just cloned with `git`:

```bash
cd assign1-YOUR_SUNET_ID
```

Install the necessary local dependencies with `npm`:

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the assignment

Run the local server:

```
npm start
```

Your browser should open up to http://localhost:4000 where you can begin the assignment.

## Submit

### Before you submit

Ensure that the sanity tests pass:

```bash
npm test
```

This command just runs a basic sanity test that ensures your project passes `npm run lint`, has the right folder structure, and doesn't have any blank required files. If `npm test` doesn't report any errors that doesn't necessarily mean that you've solved every exercise perfectly!

### The moment of truth

When you're ready to submit your work, run the commands:

```bash
git commit -am 'submit'
git push
```
