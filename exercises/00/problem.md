## You made it to Assignment 1! âœ¨

If you're reading this, then you were able to get everything set up. Nice work! You can see the exercies you'll need to complete listed to the left.

## What just happened to your computer?

You are currently running a local HTTP server that's serving this workshop website to you. Look up at the URL bar of your browser. You can see the hostname (<script>document.write(window.location.hostname)</script>) and port (<script>document.write(window.location.port)</script>) of the local server.

In addition to this workshop HTTP server, we've also running many other local HTTP servers which are vulnerable to attack in various ways. Most of the exercises you will complete involve attacking or defending these vulnerable local servers. For security, these local HTTP servers are only listening on the local interface (`127.0.0.1`) and should not be accessible to other users on your local network. This means that folks connected to e.g. the same cafe Wi-Fi as you cannot connect to `http://<your-local-ip-address>:<port>` and try to attack these vulnerable local servers.

## What is your goal?

Since we're doing client-side attacks in this assignment, your goal is to come up with "attack inputs" that when entered into websites vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks you are able to execute any code you want in the victim's browser. Usually, this will involve you testing the "attack input" by entering it into a form input field, or as a URL parameter, etc. Once you can execute code in the victim's browser, you can prove this by calling the `success()` function that we've created for you. Remember to save the attack inputs which you produce into the `SOLUTIONS.md` file. This is what you will submit for grading.

## A quick note for the devious among you (all of you?)

Keep in mind when you design your attacks that you are attacking a server running on your own computer. So don't try to `rm -rf` the server thinking you're super clever. This will end badly for you! ðŸ¤£ This fact isn't super relevant for this assignment since you'll mainly be devising client-side attacks, but it's good to know what's going on nonetheless.

## Another note for the extra, extra devious among you

We haven't attempted to secure this workshop from *you*. You have all the source code and it's running on your machine, so you are able to freely examine the source code if you're curious how this workshop is designed. This means that it is possible for you to fake calls to `success()` or to modify the local state file to instantly "finish" all the challenges. I ask you to avoid trying this since it'll just make the assignments less fun for you if you read ahead. Since you have to submit your solutions in a separate text file anyway, this doesn't really help you anyway.

## Let's get going!
