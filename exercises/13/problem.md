## Goal

Find the XSS vulnerability in their code. You can use any HTML that you want.

## Tip

Unlike previous exercises, you may need to modify the URL directly.

<iframe src='http://localhost:4130'></iframe>

Before you move on to the next exercise, remember to copy your "attack input" into the `SOLUTIONS.md` file.
